These are all the important files I need for my theme and setup, the rest is either default (or specific to a computer), or generated

Anything in 'home' just goes in the home directory, and 'scripts' can go anywhere, I put them in '/usr/local/bin'. Everything else (folders and files) go in '\~/.config/'. However, I keep it all here, and link everything to the needed locations, both to keep all config in one place, and allow this repository to hold everything, while still using default locations like '\~/.config' and '/usr/local/bin'.

(I will add information to this as I think of it or as it is needed)
